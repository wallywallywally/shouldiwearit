This dataset is smaller than the one in the original paper, 
because we have removed some repeated images and irrelevant image pairs.

- Research use only.
- Make sure that 77546 images are included in total.
- Image file name: sprintf( 'PID%06d_CLEAN%d_IID%06d', product_id, is_product_image, image_id )
